Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of a computer program to perform tasks or reasoning processes that we usually associate with intelligence in a human being. https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare/our-insights/transforming-healthcare-with-ai.

# AI can help in the medical industry in various ways, such as:

## Diagnosing patients: 

AI can analyze medical data and images to detect diseases, anomalies, or risks that might be missed by human doctors. For example, AI can help diagnose skin cancer by analyzing images of skin lesionshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare, or detect COVID-19 from chest x-rayshttps://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence-medicine.

## Discovering and developing drugs: 

AI can accelerate the process of drug discovery and development by screening millions of molecules, predicting their properties, and designing new compounds. For example, AI can help identify potential treatments for COVID-19 by repurposing existing drugs

•  Improving communication between physician and patient: AI can enhance the interaction between doctors and patients by providing virtual assistants, chatbots, or voice assistants that can answer questions, provide information, or offer guidance. For example, AI can help patients manage their chronic conditions by providing personalized feedback and coachinghttps://healthcareweekly.com/artificial-intelligence-in-healthcare/, or assist doctors in documenting their clinical notes by transcribing their speechhttps://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence-medicine.

•  Transcribing medical documents: AI can help reduce the administrative burden of healthcare professionals by automating the process of creating, storing, and retrieving medical records. For example, AI can help extract relevant information from unstructured data sources, such as handwritten notes, images, or audio fileshttps://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence-medicine, or generate summaries of clinical encountershttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare.

•  Remotely treating patients: AI can enable the delivery of healthcare services to patients who are not physically present in a healthcare facility, such as those who live in rural areas, have mobility issues, or are under quarantine. For example, AI can help monitor patients' vital signs and alert clinicians if they need interventionhttps://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence-medicine, or provide telemedicine consultations using video conferencing or chat platformshttps://healthcareweekly.com/artificial-intelligence-in-healthcare/.

These are some of the ways that AI can help in the medical industry. However, there are also challenges and risks associated with the use of AI in healthcare, such as ethical issues, data privacy and security, human oversight and accountability, and social and economic implications. Therefore, it is important to ensure that AI is developed and deployed in a responsible and trustworthy manner that respects human dignity, autonomy, and rights.

Ez egy egyszerűpéldamondat leiras, ami nem szol semmiről csak arról hogy teljenek a sorok és megnézzem hogy a szerkesztett szöveg hogyan viselkedik élő környezetben a honlapon. Ez arra is szolgál hogy lássam ténylegesen hogyan sikerült megszerkesztenem a markdawn röviden .md fájlt amit program megjelenit a böngészőben.
