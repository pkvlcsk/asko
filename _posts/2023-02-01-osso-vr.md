Surgery is a complex and critical skill that requires extensive training and practice. Surgery can also be challenging and stressful, especially in new or unfamiliar situations. However, surgical training and practice can be limited and expensive, especially with traditional methods, such as cadavers, models, or simulations. That's why Osso VR, a US-based company, has developed a virtual reality platform that trains surgeons and medical students.

Osso VR is a virtual reality platform that can train surgeons and medical students on various surgical procedures and techniques. It consists of a headset, controllers, and software that can create a realistic and immersive surgical environment. Osso VR can simulate various types of surgery, such as orthopedic, cardiovascular, or neurosurgery. It can also simulate various scenarios, such as emergency, trauma, or elective surgery.

It can also assess and evaluate the skills and knowledge of the users. It can also customize and personalize the training and practice according to the needs and goals of the users. Osso VR can also connect and collaborate with other users or instructors for support and advice.

Osso VR is designed to be user-friendly and accessible. It is easy to set up and use, and does not require any special equipment or space. It is also flexible and adaptable, and can work with any device or system. Osso VR is suitable for anyone who wants to train or practice surgery, especially surgeons, medical students, or educators.

Osso VR is an innovative solution that combines virtual reality technology with surgical technology. It is the first virtual reality platform of its kind that can train surgeons and medical students on various surgical procedures and techniques. It is also easy to use and affordable.
