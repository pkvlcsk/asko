Breast cancer is the most common and deadly cancer among women worldwide, affecting millions of people every year. Breast cancer can be treated by various methods, such as surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. Surgery is the most effective and preferred method, as it can remove the tumor and prevent its recurrence. However, surgery can also be challenging and risky, especially if the tumor is small, deep, or hard to locate. That's why Molli Surgical, a Canadian company, has developed a surgical device that removes breast cancer with precision and safety.

Molli Surgical is a surgical device that can remove breast cancer tumors with minimal damage and scarring. It consists of a handheld device that can insert a thin wire into the tumor, and a console that can control the device and display the tumor location. Molli Surgical uses magnetic technology to guide the wire to the tumor, and radiofrequency technology to cut and seal the tissue around the tumor. Molli Surgical can remove the tumor in one piece, without leaving any fragments or debris behind.

Molli Surgical is not only a removal device, but also a detection device. It can detect and locate the tumor before the surgery, using a magnetic marker that is injected into the tumor. The marker can emit a magnetic signal that can be picked up by the device, and show the exact position and size of the tumor. Molli Surgical can also verify and confirm the removal of the tumor after the surgery, using a sensor that can detect any residual magnetic signal.

Molli Surgical is designed to be user-friendly and efficient. It is easy to use and operate, and does not require any special training or equipment. It is also fast and accurate, and can remove the tumor in less than 10 minutes. Molli Surgical is suitable for anyone who wants to undergo or perform breast cancer surgery, especially people who have small or hard-to-find tumors.

Molli Surgical is an innovative solution that combines magnetic technology with radiofrequency technology. It is the first surgical device of its kind that can remove breast cancer tumors with precision and safety. It is also easy to use and affordable. Molli Surgical is currently available for purchase on its website, and is covered by most insurance plans.

Molli Surgical is more than just a surgical device. It is a surgical device that removes breast cancer with precision and safety.
