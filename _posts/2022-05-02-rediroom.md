Infection prevention and control (IPC) is a crucial aspect of healthcare, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. IPC aims to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases among patients, staff, and visitors, and to ensure a safe and hygienic environment. However, IPC can be challenging and costly, especially in busy and crowded settings, such as hospitals, clinics, or care homes. That's why Gama Healthcare, a UK-based company, has developed Rediroom, a portable solution for IPC.

Rediroom is a portable isolation room that can be deployed in minutes to create a safe and sterile space for patients or staff. Rediroom consists of a metal frame and a plastic cover that can fit over any standard hospital bed or trolley. Rediroom has a built-in ventilation system that creates negative pressure inside the room, preventing any contaminated air from escaping. Rediroom also has a UV-C light that disinfects the room after each use.

Rediroom is not only an isolation room, but also a flexible and versatile room. It can be used for various purposes, such as screening, testing, triage, or treatment. It can also be used for different types of patients, such as infectious, immunocompromised, or palliative. Rediroom can also be customized to suit different needs and preferences, such as adding windows, doors, or curtains.

Rediroom is designed to be user-friendly and efficient. It is lightweight, compact, and easy to transport and store. It can be assembled and disassembled by one person in less than 10 minutes. It also has a low maintenance and operational cost, and does not require any special training or equipment. Rediroom is suitable for anyone who wants to improve IPC in their healthcare setting, especially in situations where space or resources are limited.

Rediroom is an innovative solution that combines portability with IPC. It is the first device of its kind that can create a portable isolation room in minutes. It is also easy to use and adaptable. Rediroom is currently being used in several hospitals and care homes in the UK, and has received positive feedback from users. Gama Healthcare plans to expand its market and reach more customers in the near future.

Rediroom is more than just a portable room. It is a portable solution for IPC.
