Prosthetic hands are artificial devices that replace the function and appearance of missing or damaged hands. Prosthetic hands can help restore the ability and confidence of people who have lost their hands due to injury, disease, or birth defect. However, most prosthetic hands are limited and unnatural, and do not provide the same level of movement and sensation as natural hands. That's why Esper Bionics, a US-based company, has developed Esper Hand, a prosthetic hand that mimics natural movement and sensation.

Esper Hand is a prosthetic hand that can be attached to the wrist or elbow of the user. It is made of lightweight and durable materials, and has a realistic and aesthetic design. Esper Hand uses advanced technology to deliver smooth and precise movement and sensation. It can sense the user's muscle signals and intentions, and move the fingers and thumb accordingly. It can also provide tactile feedback and vibration to the user, simulating the touch and feel of objects.

Esper Hand is not only a functional device, but also a personal device. It can be customized and personalized to suit the user's preferences and needs. It can be adjusted in size, shape, color, and skin tone. It can also be programmed with different gestures, modes, and settings, such as pinch, grip, or point. Esper Hand can also connect to various devices, such as smartphones, computers, or games, via Bluetooth or wireless connection.

Esper Hand is designed to be user-friendly and convenient. It has a long battery life and fast charging. It also has a high level of safety and security, and can detect and avoid any potential hazards or damage. Esper Hand is suitable for anyone who wants to regain their hand function and experience, especially people with upper limb amputation or congenital limb deficiency.

Esper Hand is an innovative solution that combines prosthetic technology with bionic technology. It is the first prosthetic hand of its kind that mimics natural movement and sensation. It is also easy to use and affordable. Esper Hand is currently undergoing clinical trials and regulatory approval, and is expected to be available in the market soon.

Esper Hand is more than just a prosthetic hand. It is a prosthetic hand that mimics natural movement and sensation.
